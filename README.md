# Financial Data Dashboard Report:
# Summary:

The Financial Data Dashboard has been designed and developed using Power BI, incorporating ETL processes, data cleaning, validation, and formatting to present a comprehensive view of the financial performance of the company. The dashboard provides valuable insights into sales, profits, units sold, and discounts across various segments, countries, and products. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Gross Sales, Sales, Profits, and Units Sold have been incorporated to enable quick and informed decision-making. Additionally, a slicer for the year has been included for a more granular analysis.

# ETL Process: 

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was implemented to ensure that the data used in the dashboard is accurate and reliable. Raw financial data was extracted from the source, transformed to clean and structured formats, and then loaded into Power BI for analysis. During the transformation phase, duplicate values were removed, and data was validated to ensure consistency and accuracy.
# Data Cleaning and Processing: 
Data cleaning involved identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. The cleaned data was processed to create meaningful metrics for analysis. Date formats were standardized for uniformity, ensuring accurate time-based analysis in the dashboard.
